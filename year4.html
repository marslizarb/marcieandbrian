            <p>After two years studying psychology at UCLA, Marcie decided to transfer to MCAD, an art school in Minneapolis, so that she could study animation. Now that we were living in the same city again, we visited each other every weekend. Usually, we spent time at the UMN because Marcie's roommates at MCAD were always naked (for art). It was a happy year for us—we were used to being apart for months at a time, but now we finally had the chance to be a normal couple.</p>
