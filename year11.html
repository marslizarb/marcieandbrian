            <p>Marcie spent this year working on a short animation for a film fellowship. As always, I spent it working on my dissertation. Our new two-bedroom apartment was much larger and better lit than our old studio. Of course, it was still tiny: when we visited the New York City Tenement Museum, we discovered that our building was identical to the one that the curators had selected to exemplify the horrors of exploitative, Depression-era housing. Luckily, now that COVID-19 restrictions had loosened, we were free to travel more often. In September, we went back to Minnesota for a friend’s wedding. In March, we took a short trip to Baltimore before going to Walt Disney World with my family.</p>

My neurologist charged me $100 to confirm that my face was, in fact, half paralyzed. Fortunately, the paralysis completely went away within a few months. Unfortunately, before I recovered, I was photographed frequently as a member of my friend's wedding party. Here, Brian and I are en route to her rehearsal dinner. If my face is once again half paralyzed before our wedding, I will have to make masks mandatory for all attendees, including myself.</p>
