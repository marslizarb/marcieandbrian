            <p>Time lost all meaning during the second year of COVID-19. Marcie started animating for a Netflix show whose nerdiest viewers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/p8ny0x/this_is_the_giuoco_piano_according_to_netflixs/" target="_blank">cyberbullied</a> her because of a small mistake in her depiction of a chess match that appeared on screen for less than one second. After weeping hysterically for days, she vowed that she would only play checkers for the rest of her life. Meanwhile, I continued to write my dissertation. Marcie and I both worked from home in our small, dark studio apartment, which made us feel like we were living in a submarine. During the summer, we took a short trip to the Catskills with our friends. There, we decided that we needed a bigger apartment, so we moved into a new building a few blocks south of our old one.</p>
