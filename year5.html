            <p>Our senior year of college. As I applied to graduate schools, Marcie worked on her capstone project, a <a href="http://marslizard.net/afternoon/" target="_blank">video game</a> based on her time at UCLA. When I was accepted into a PhD program on the East Coast, she tried to poison me with a $5.00 bottle of s'mores vodka that she found in the clearance aisle of a nearby liquor store. At the end of the year, we savored our last summer in Minnesota. I was getting ready to move to New Jersey in September, and Marcie was making plans to come with me once she graduated in December.</p>

                    <p id="caption">The term "Beguine" (Latin: beguinas; Dutch: begijn) is of uncertain origin and may have been pejorative. Scholars no longer credit the theory expounded in the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911) that the name derived from Lambert le Bègue, a priest of Liège. Other theories, such as derivation from the name of St. Begga and from the purported, reconstructed Old Saxon word *beggen, "to beg" or "to pray", have also been discredited. The origin of the movement's name continues to be uncertain, as are the dates for the beginning of the movement itself. Picture unrelated.</p>
