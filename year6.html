            <p>In September, I moved to New Brunswick, New Jersey, for graduate school. Meanwhile, Marcie finished her degree at MCAD. We were a long-distance couple for the second time in our relationship—but this time, it was only a semester before we were reunited. Marcie moved to New Brunswick in December, and we started to share an apartment. When she first walked through the door, she compared our unit to a prison because everything was grey and there were no decorations on the walls. This was unfair of her: our couch was black, not grey, and I had decorated the living room with a single 8½ x 11” printed photo of my family’s pet cat, Scout.</p>
