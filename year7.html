            <p>While Marcie got what she calls her “first big girl adult job” at NPR, I started teaching college writing courses. Meanwhile, we immersed ourselves in the best of New Brunswick culture. On July 4, we braved the sweltering heat to watch George Washington and his Continental Army parade through a public park. The air swam with heat. Sweat drenched our backs. Strangely, no crowd had gathered. Even after more than an hour, America’s heroic founder was nowhere to be seen. Had he sensed that something was awry in our great country and, scowling at us from his throne in Heaven, refused to grace us with his presence? Devastated by his failure to appear, Marcie and I packed our bags and moved to New York City.</p>
